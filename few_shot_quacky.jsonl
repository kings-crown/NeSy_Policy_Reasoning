This means that any operation, such as reading, writing, or deleting files, can be performed on the contents of this bucket.\n\n2. **Prevent Deletion of the Bucket and Certain Actions**:\n   - The second part of the statement explicitly denies certain actions to ensure the bucket itself and some of its configurations cannot be deleted.

This includes operations like \"s3:GetObject\" (reading), \"s3:PutObject\" (writing), and \"s3:DeleteObject\" (deleting files). The wildcard character \"*\" is a common convention in permission systems to denote \"all actions,\" and when applied to the context of S3 objects, it means users can perform any operation on the contents of the bucket.\n\n2. **Prevent Deletion of the Bucket and Certain Actions**:\n   - The explicit denial of specific actions such as \"s3:DeleteBucket,\" \"s3:DeleteBucketPolicy,\" \"s3:DeleteBucketWebsite,\" and \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\" serves as a safeguard against altering or removing the bucket and its critical configurations. By listing these actions in a deny statement, the policy ensures that even though users have broad permissions on the bucket's contents, they cannot delete the bucket itself, its policy, its website configuration, or specific object versions. This is a common practice to protect the integrity and existence of the bucket and its essential settings.\n\nIn summary, the permissions are structured to allow flexibility and full control over the objects within the bucket while simultaneously protecting the bucket's existence and key configurations from being altered or deleted.

Here's an informal proof sketch that explains why the policy allows any user to perform any action on certain objects in an S3 bucket:\n\n1. **Statement Identifier (Sid)**: The \"Sid\" is simply a label for the policy statement. It doesn't affect the permissions but helps identify the rule. Think of it as a name tag for easy reference.\n\n2. **Action (\"s3:*\")**: The policy specifies \"s3:*\" as the action, which means all actions related to Amazon S3 are included. This encompasses a wide range of operations, such as listing, uploading, downloading, and deleting objects. In mathematical terms, this is like saying the set of allowed actions is the entire set of possible S3 actions.\n\n3. **Effect (\"Allow\")**: The effect is \"Allow\", which means the actions specified are permitted. In logical terms, this is akin to stating that if the conditions are met, the actions are allowed without restriction.\n\n4. **Resource (\"arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*\")**: The resource specifies the scope of the policy. Here, it targets all objects within the \"examplebucket\" S3 bucket. The wildcard (*) indicates that the policy applies to every object in the bucket. This is like defining a subset of objects within a universal set (the bucket).\n\n5. **Condition (Prefix \"mp3\")**: The condition adds a constraint that the policy only applies to objects with names starting with \"mp3\". This is a filtering mechanism, similar to setting a condition in a mathematical function that limits its domain.\n\n6. **Principal (\"*\")**: The principal is \"*\", meaning the policy applies to any user or entity. In set theory, this is equivalent to saying the policy is universally applicable to all elements (users) in the set of possible principals.\n\nBy combining these components, the policy effectively states: \"For any user, allow all S3 actions on objects in the 'examplebucket' bucket, provided the object's name starts with 'mp3'.\" This is a logical conjunction of conditions that must all be satisfied for the permissions to be granted.

This aligns with the statement that the policy allows certain actions to be performed, specifically the creation and deletion of users.\n\n2. **Condition on Email Addresses**: The policy includes a condition that restricts these actions to users whose email addresses end with \"@domain.com\". This is typically implemented using a condition block in the JSON policy, which checks the \"Principal\" or \"Resource\" attributes to ensure they match the specified pattern. This supports the statement that these actions can only be performed on users with email addresses ending in \"@domain.com\".\n\n3. **Resource Specification**: The policy applies to resources specified by ARNs (Amazon Resource Names). The use of asterisks (*) in the ARN indicates a wildcard, meaning the policy is not restricted to a specific AWS account or resource. Instead, it applies broadly across all accounts. This matches the statement that the policy applies to all AWS accounts.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By examining the structure and components of the policy, we see that it indeed grants permissions to create and delete users with specific email conditions across any AWS account.

{"xi": "This text describes a set of permissions related to Amazon S3, a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's a breakdown of what it means:\n\n1. **General Permission**: \n   - The first part of the statement grants permission to perform any action (`s3:*`) on any S3 resource (`arn:aws:s3:::*`). This means that, in general, the user or entity this policy applies to can do anything with any S3 bucket or object. The effect of this permission is \"Allow,\" meaning these actions are permitted.\n\n2. **Specific Restriction**:\n   - The second part of the statement introduces a specific restriction. It has a unique identifier (`Sid`) called \"NoBucketDelete.\" This part denies permission to perform any action (`s3:*`) on any S3 resource (`arn:aws:s3:::*`). The effect here is \"Deny,\" which means that despite the general permission to perform all actions, there is a specific prohibition in place.\n\nIn summary, while the policy initially allows all actions on all S3 resources, it specifically denies the ability to delete S3 buckets. This is a common practice to prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of important data, even when other actions are permitted.", "xf": "theorem s3_star_allow_and_deny_policy_correctness:\n  shows\n    \"evaluate_policies policies s3_any All = Allow\"\n  and\n    \"evaluate_policies policies s3_any (Specific ''arn:aws:s3:::*'') = Deny\"\n  using allow_on_all_resources deny_on_specific_resource\n  by auto", "yi": "To understand the permissions described in the text, we can use an informal proof approach similar to reasoning about sets and their operations in mathematics.\n\n1. **General Permission (Universal Set Analogy)**:\n   - The statement begins by granting a broad permission: `s3:*` on `arn:aws:s3:::*`. This can be likened to defining a universal set \\( U \\) where every possible action on every possible S3 resource is included. In set terms, this is akin to saying the user has access to the entire set of actions and resources without restriction. The effect \"Allow\" means that all elements (actions and resources) in this universal set are accessible.\n\n2. **Specific Restriction (Set Subtraction Analogy)**:\n   - The second part introduces a specific restriction with the identifier \"NoBucketDelete.\" This restriction denies permission to perform any action (`s3:*`) on any S3 resource (`arn:aws:s3:::*`). However, the context implies that the denial is specifically targeted at preventing bucket deletion. In set terms, this is akin to subtracting a subset \\( D \\) (representing the delete bucket action) from the universal set \\( U \\). The effect \"Deny\" acts as a subtraction operation, removing the ability to delete buckets from the user's permissions.\n\n3. **Conclusion (Set Difference Result)**:\n   - The overall effect of the policy is the set difference \\( U - D \\), where \\( U \\) is the set of all possible actions and \\( D \\) is the specific action of deleting buckets. This results in a new set of permissions where the user can perform any action except for deleting buckets.
