The first assumption is that `v` is in the range of `f`, and the second assumption is that for any `x`, if `f x = Some v`, then `R` holds. 2. **Existence of `x`**: Using the first assumption, we use the `obtain` construct to extract an `x` such that `f x = Some v`. This is done using the definition of `ran` (range), which states that `v` is in the range of `f` if there exists some `x` such that `f x = Some v`. 3. **Application of the Condition**: With the specific `x` for which `f x = Some v`, we apply the second assumption. This directly gives us `R` because the condition `f x = Some v` is satisfied. 4. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes by showing that `R` holds, as required by the lemma. ### Use of `sledgehammer`: In this proof, `sledgehammer` could be used to suggest the application of `auto` and `blast` tactics, which are powerful automated tools in Isabelle.

This is the premise of our implication. 2. **Using `simp`**: The `simp` method in Isabelle is used to simplify expressions. Here, `the (Some x)` simplifies directly to `x` because `the` is defined to extract the value from `Some`. 3. **Chain of Equalities**: We use the `also` and `finally` keywords to chain equalities. This is a common technique in Isabelle to show that a series of transformations lead to the desired result. 4. **Conclusion**: Finally, we conclude that `x = the v` using the transitive property of equality. ### Using `sledgehammer`: In this particular case, the lemma is quite straightforward, and `simp` is sufficient to prove it. However, if you were to use `sledgehammer`, it would likely suggest using `simp` or `auto`, as these are powerful methods for handling such basic simplifications in Isabelle. If you want to see what `sledgehammer` suggests, you can insert it into the proof script like this: ```isabelle lemma Some_to_the: \"v = Some x \\<Longrightarrow> x = the v\" proof - assume \"v = Some x\" then show \"x = the v\" by (sledgehammer) qed ``` Running `sledgehammer` will give you suggestions, and in this case, it will likely confirm that `simp` or `auto` can solve the goal."}

We assume the opposite of what we want to prove, i.e., `x = y`. 4. **Derive a Contradiction**: If `x = y`, then by the properties of equality and the function application, `f x = f y`. This directly contradicts our assumption `f x \\<noteq> f y`. 5. **Conclusion**: The contradiction implies that our assumption `x = y` must be false, hence `x \\<noteq> y`.

The lemma states that for any natural number \\( y \\), it is either greater than zero or equal to zero. This is a fundamental property of natural numbers.

In Isabelle, natural numbers are defined inductively with two cases: either \\( y \\) is zero (`0`) or it is the successor of another natural number (`Suc n`). 2. **Case 0**: - If \\( y = 0 \\), then the statement \"0 < y \\<or> 0 = y\" simplifies to \"0 = 0\", which is trivially true. We use `then show ?thesis by simp` to conclude this case. 3. **Case Suc n**: - If \\( y = Suc n \\) (meaning \\( y \\) is the successor of some natural number \\( n \\), and hence greater than zero), the statement \"0 < y \\<or> 0 = y\" simplifies to \"0 < Suc n\", which is also trivially true.

We establish this with `have \"min a b = a\" by simp`. - We need to show `a - b + a = a`. Since `a < b`, `a - b` evaluates to `0` in the natural numbers (as subtraction in `nat` is truncated at zero), which is shown by `from False have \"a - b = 0\" by simp`. - Finally, we conclude `a - b + a = a` using `show \"a - b + a = a\" by simp`.

The base case is when the list is empty (`Nil`), and the inductive step considers the list as a head element `a` followed by a tail `list`. 3. **Base Case**: If the list is empty, mapping any function over it results in an empty list, so the base case is trivially true. 4. **Inductive Step**: - We assume the inductive hypothesis that `map f list = list` holds for the tail of the list. - We show that `f a = a` using the assumption `\\<And>q. m \\<le> q \\<Longrightarrow> q < n \\<Longrightarrow> f q = q`. - We then prove that `map f list = list` using the inductive hypothesis and the assumption for elements in the tail. - Combining these, we conclude that `map f (a # list) = a # list`, which completes the inductive step. 5. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes by showing that the lemma holds for all cases, completing the induction.

From the premise `find P (a # xs) = Some x`, we conclude `x = a`. Thus, `P x` holds, and `x` is in the list `a # xs`. - **Case `P a = False`:** If `P a` is false, then `find P (a # xs) = find P xs`. The premise `find P (a # xs) = Some x` implies `find P xs = Some x`. By the induction hypothesis, `P x` holds, and `x` is in the list `xs`. Therefore, `x` is also in the list `a # xs`. 4. **Conclusion:** In both cases, we have shown that if `find P xs = Some x`, then `P x` holds and `x` is in the list `xs`. This structured proof follows the informal reasoning and uses `sledgehammer` to assist in finding the necessary steps, particularly in the inductive step where `blast` is used to resolve the hypothesis."}

This is captured by the lemma `shiftr1_eq_div2` in Isabelle, which states that `i div 2 = i >> 1`. - **Right Shift as Drop Bit**: The operation of right shifting by 1 bit is equivalent to dropping the least significant bit. This is captured by the lemma `drop_bit_eq_shiftr`, which states that `i >> 1 = drop_bit 1 i`. 3. **Proof Steps**: - We start by rewriting `i div 2` as `i >> 1` using the lemma `shiftr1_eq_div2`. - Next, we rewrite `i >> 1` as `drop_bit 1 i` using the lemma `drop_bit_eq_shiftr`. - Finally, we chain these equalities together to conclude the proof. 4. **Using `sledgehammer`**: In this case, `sledgehammer` can be used to find the relevant lemmas (`shiftr1_eq_div2` and `drop_bit_eq_shiftr`) if they are not already known. It can suggest these lemmas based on the goal and the available facts in the Isabelle environment.

Since `x` is a natural number, it can either be `0` or `Suc n` for some `n`. 3. **Case 0**: If `x = 0`, this contradicts the assumption `x > 0`. Hence, this case is dismissed. 4. **Case Suc n**: If `x = Suc n`, we use the assumption `x \\<le> Suc 0` to derive `Suc n \\<le> Suc 0`, which simplifies to `n \\<le> 0`.

This is because the structure of `xs` will guide the proof, and `ys` will follow due to the length constraint. 2. **Base Case (`Nil`)**: When `xs` is empty, `ys` must also be empty due to the length constraint. The result is trivial as both sides of the equation are `[]`. 3. **Inductive Step (`Cons`)**: Assume the property holds for `xs`, and prove it for `x # xs`. - We decompose `ys` into `y # ys'` since `length xs = length ys` implies `ys` is non-empty when `xs` is non-empty. - We apply the induction hypothesis to `xs` and `ys'`. - We then handle the case where `xs` is non-empty separately to ensure the rotation logic is correctly applied. 4. **Case Analysis on `xs`**: We further analyze the structure of `xs` to handle the rotation correctly. This involves checking if `xs` is empty or a `Cons` list. 5. **Simplification**: Throughout the proof, we use `simp` to simplify expressions, especially after applying the induction hypothesis. 6. **Use of `sledgehammer`**: While the proof is structured manually, `sledgehammer` can be used at various points to find lemmas or tactics that simplify parts of the proof, especially in handling list operations and equalities.

This is the universally quantified statement we need to prove. 3. **Fixing an Element**: We use `fix x` to consider an arbitrary element `x`. However, since `S = {}`, there are no elements in `S`. 4. **Assumption and Contradiction**: We assume `x \\<in> S`. Given `S = {}`, this assumption leads to a contradiction because there cannot be any `x` in an empty set. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the assumption `x \\<in> S` is false, the statement `P x` is vacuously true.

This allows us to use the fact that `ys` can be decomposed into a head `y1` and a tail `ys'`, i.e., `ys = y1 # ys'`. 2. **Simplification**: - We then simplify `zip [a] ys` using the definition of `ys` as `y1 # ys'`. The `zip` function will pair the first element of `[a]` with the first element of `ys`, which is `y1`. 3. **Zipping**: - The `zip` operation on `[a]` and `y1 # ys'` results in `[(a, y1)]` because `[a]` has only one element, so the zipping process stops after the first pair. 4. **Conclusion**: - Finally, we conclude that `zip [a] ys = [(a, ys ! 0)]` by recognizing that `ys ! 0` is `y1`, the first element of `ys`.

This is done using the `signed_take_bit_eq_take_bit` lemma. 2. **Rewriting the Expression:** - We aim to show that `take_bit (Suc n) k - (if k < 0 then 2 ^ Suc n else 0)` is equivalent to `take_bit (Suc n) (k + 2 ^ n) - 2 ^ n`. 3. **Using `take_bit_add`:** - We use the property of `take_bit` with addition: `take_bit (Suc n) (k + 2 ^ n) = take_bit (Suc n) k + (if k < 0 then 2 ^ n else 0)`. This helps in aligning the expressions. 4. **Simplification:** - Simplify the expression using algebraic manipulation to show the equivalence. 5. **Conclusion:** - The final step combines the transformations to conclude the proof. ### Using `sledgehammer`: - Throughout the proof, you can use `sledgehammer` to find relevant lemmas or simplifications that might assist in proving intermediate steps.

We start by assuming the premise `distinct xs`. 2. **Induction on `xs`**: We perform induction on the list `xs`, which is a common technique for reasoning about properties of lists. 3. **Base Case (`Nil`)**: If `xs` is empty, then `take n xs` is also empty, and an empty list is trivially distinct. This is handled by `simp`. 4. **Inductive Case (`Cons`)**: For a non-empty list `xs = x # xs'`, we consider two cases for `n`: - **Case `0`**: If `n = 0`, then `take n xs` is `[]`, which is distinct. - **Case `Suc n'`**: If `n = Suc n'`, then `take n xs = x # take n' xs'`. We use the induction hypothesis that `distinct xs'` implies `distinct (take n' xs')`. Since `x` is distinct from all elements in `xs'` (by the distinctness of `xs`), `x # take n' xs'` is distinct. 5. **Use of `sledgehammer`**: While the proof is straightforward, `sledgehammer` can be used to find lemmas or automate parts of the proof, especially for the `distinct` property and list operations. However, in this case, the proof is simple enough that manual reasoning suffices. This structured proof follows the informal reasoning and uses induction to handle the list structure, ensuring that the distinctness property is preserved when taking the first `n` elements."}

This is done using the lemma `map_upt_add_eq`. 2. **Mapping Function Application**: - We apply the function `f` to each element of the list, resulting in `map f (map (\\<lambda>n. n + a) [0 ..< b - a])`, which simplifies to `map (\\<lambda>n. f (n + a)) [0 ..< b - a]` using `map_map`. 3. **Adjusting the Elements**: - We introduce the transformation `n + a - x + x` to show the equivalence, which simplifies to `n + a`. This step is trivial and uses basic arithmetic simplification. 4. **Reindexing the Transformed List**: - We express the transformation in terms of the new index `n + x`, resulting in `map (\\<lambda>n. f (n + a - x)) (map (\\<lambda>n. n + x) [0 ..< b - a])`. 5. **Final Transformation**: - Finally, we rewrite the transformed list back to the form `[x ..< x + b - a]` using `map_upt_add_eq`. 6. **Conclusion**: - By chaining these transformations together, we conclude that the original mapping is equivalent to the transformed mapping, completing the proof.

We need to show `a = b`. - From the premise `(y, z) ∈ r` and the condition `∀x.

This is a common technique when dealing with recursive functions like `foldl` and `foldr`. 2. **Base Case (`Nil`)**: When `xs` is an empty list, both `foldl` and `foldr` simplify to `x`, which is trivially equal. This is shown using `simp`. 3. **Inductive Step (`Cons`)**: Assume the lemma holds for a list `xs`. We need to show it holds for `a # xs`. - We first simplify `foldl (+) x (a # xs)` to `foldl (+) (x + a) xs` using the definition of `foldl`. - By the induction hypothesis, `foldl (+) (x + a) xs` equals `foldr (+) ((x + a) # xs) 0`. - We then use the definition of `foldr` to expand `foldr (+) ((x + a) # xs) 0` to `x + a + foldr (+) xs 0`. - Using the associativity of addition, we rewrite this as `x + foldr (+) (a # xs) 0`. - Finally, we show that this is equal to `foldr (+) (x # a # xs) 0`, completing the inductive step. 4. **Commutative Monoid Properties**: The proof relies on the properties of a commutative monoid, specifically associativity and commutativity of addition, which are encapsulated in the type class `'a::comm_monoid_add`.

The base case (`k = 0`) is straightforward since no division occurs, and the bits remain unchanged. 2. **Base Case (`k = 0`)**: When `k = 0`, the function `(\\<lambda>k. k div 2) ^^ 0` is the identity function, so the bits of `w` are unchanged. This is shown by `simp`. 3. **Inductive Step (`k = Suc k`)**: - Assume the inductive hypothesis (IH) holds for `k`. - We express `(((\\<lambda>k. k div 2) ^^ Suc k) w)` as `(((\\<lambda>k. k div 2) ^^ k) (w div 2))`, which is a direct application of the function composition. - By the inductive hypothesis, `bit (((\\<lambda>k. k div 2) ^^ k) (w div 2)) n = bit (w div 2) (n + k)`. - Using the property `bit_div_2`, we know that `bit (w div 2) n = bit w (n + 1)`. Applying this property, we adjust the indices accordingly. - Finally, we conclude that `bit w (n + Suc k)` is the desired result.

This is because `Bit0` shifts the bits of `x` one position to the left, inserting a `0` at the least significant bit position. ```isabelle proof - fix x :: num and n :: nat show \"(bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral (num.Bit0 x)) n \\<longleftrightarrow> n > 0 \\<and> (bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral x) (n - 1)\" proof (cases n) case 0 then show ?thesis by simp next case (Suc m) then show ?thesis by (simp add: bit_Suc) qed qed ``` ### Part 2: Numeral Constructed with `Bit1` The second part of the lemma states: ```isabelle lemma bin_nth_numeral_unfold_Bit1: \"(bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral (num.Bit1 x)) n \\<longleftrightarrow> (n > 0 \\<longrightarrow> (bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral x) (n - 1))\" ``` **Proof:** 1. **Base Case (`n = 0`):** For `n = 0`, the `0`-th bit of `Bit1 x` is `1` because `Bit1` appends a `1` to the binary representation, making it odd. Thus, the left-hand side is `True`, and the right-hand side is also `True` since `n > 0` is `False`. 2. **Inductive Step (`n > 0`):** For `n > 0`, the `n`-th bit of `Bit1 x` corresponds to the `(n-1)`-th bit of `x`, similar to `Bit0`. ```isabelle proof - fix x :: num and n :: nat show \"(bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral (num.Bit1 x)) n \\<longleftrightarrow> (n > 0 \\<longrightarrow> (bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral x) (n - 1))\" proof (cases n) case 0 then show ?thesis by simp next case (Suc m) then show ?thesis by (simp add: bit_Suc) qed qed ``` ### Combining Both Parts Finally, we combine both parts into a single lemma: ```isabelle lemma bin_nth_numeral_unfold: \"(bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral (num.Bit0 x)) n \\<longleftrightarrow> n > 0 \\<and> (bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral x) (n - 1)\" \"(bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral (num.Bit1 x)) n \\<longleftrightarrow> (n > 0 \\<longrightarrow> (bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (numeral x) ("}

There are two cases to consider: - **Case `Nil`**: If `xs` is `[]`, then `length xs` would be `0`, which contradicts our assumption that `length xs > 0`. Therefore, this case cannot occur. - **Case `Cons a list`**: If `xs` is of the form `a # list`, then `xs` is clearly not empty, and we can conclude `xs \\<noteq> []`. 3. **Conclusion**: By considering both cases, we conclude that if `length xs > 0`, then `xs` cannot be `[]`, which completes the proof.

This leads to a contradiction because `1 = 0` is false in any type where `zero_neq_one` holds. 3. **Backward Direction (`\"\\<Longleftarrow>\"`):** - Assume `P`. - Show that `(if P then 0 else 1)` simplifies to `0` using `simp`. 4. **Use of `zero_neq_one`:** - The `zero_neq_one` class constraint ensures that `0` and `1` are distinct, which is crucial for the contradiction in the `False` case.

In this case, `simp` recognizes that `1 + 0` simplifies to `1` based on the identity property of addition. 3. **Conclusion**: After establishing that `1 + 0 = 1`, we conclude the proof with `thus ?thesis by simp`, which states that the goal follows from the established fact. 4. **`qed`**: This ends the proof block, confirming that the lemma has been proven. This structured proof effectively captures the essence of the informal solution by leveraging Isabelle's simplification capabilities to apply the identity property of addition."}

This is a basic property of natural numbers in Isabelle, and we use `simp` to perform this simplification. 3. **Conclusion**: Once we have `Suc (n - 1) = n`, the lemma follows directly by substituting this equality into the expression `bin_sc (Suc (n - 1)) b w`. 4. **Automation**: While this proof is simple enough to be done manually, you can use `sledgehammer` to attempt to find a proof automatically.

The `inj_onI` rule is used to prove injectivity by showing that if the function values are equal, then the inputs must be equal. 2. **Fixing Variables**: We fix two arbitrary elements `y` and `z` from the set `S`. 3. **Assumptions**: We assume that `y` and `z` are elements of `S` and that the pairs `(x, y)` and `(x, z)` are equal. 4. **Showing Equality**: To show that `y = z`, we use the fact that if two pairs are equal, their corresponding components must be equal. This is captured by the `prod.inject` theorem, which states that `(a, b) = (c, d)` implies `a = c` and `b = d`. 5. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes by showing that `y = z`, thus establishing the injectivity of the function `Pair x` on the set `S`.

We then perform a case analysis on whether the pair `(x, y)` is the head of the zipped list. - **Case `(x, y) = (x, y)`**: If the pair `(x, y)` is the head of the zipped list, then `x` is trivially in `set (x # xs)`. - **Case `(x, y) ≠ (x, y)`**: If the pair `(x, y)` is not the head of the zipped list, it must be in the tail `zip xs ys`. We then use the induction hypothesis (`Cons.IH`) to conclude that `x` is in `set xs`. 4. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes by showing that in both cases, `x` is indeed an element of `set xs`.

This is captured by the lemma `trunc_def`, which we prove using the `simp` tactic with the `take_bit_eq_mod` lemma. 2. **Case Analysis:** We perform a case analysis on whether `m <= n` or `n < m`. - **Case 1: `m <= n`:** - Here, `min m n = m`. - We use the property of modulus: `(a mod b) mod c = a mod c` when `c <= b`. This is captured by the `mod_mod_cancel` lemma. - Thus, `take_bit m (take_bit n w) = take_bit m w = take_bit (min m n) w`. - **Case 2: `n < m`:** - Here, `min m n = n`. - Since `n < m`, `take_bit m (take_bit n w) = take_bit n w` because further truncation to more bits does not change the result. - Therefore, `take_bit m (take_bit n w) = take_bit (min m n) w`. 3. **Using `sledgehammer`:** - In this proof, `sledgehammer` can be used to suggest lemmas like `mod_mod_cancel` or to confirm the simplifications.

This splits the proof into two cases: when `b` is `True` and when `b` is `False`. 2. **Case True**: - The assumption `b = True` is introduced by `case True`. - We need to show that `case_bool P Q True = (if True then P else Q)`. - By the definition of `case_bool`, `case_bool P Q True` simplifies to `P`. - The expression `(if True then P else Q)` also simplifies to `P`. - We conclude this case using `by simp`, which automatically simplifies both sides and confirms their equality. 3. **Case False**: - The assumption `b = False` is introduced by `case False`. - We need to show that `case_bool P Q False = (if False then P else Q)`. - By the definition of `case_bool`, `case_bool P Q False` simplifies to `Q`. - The expression `(if False then P else Q)` also simplifies to `Q`. - We conclude this case using `by simp`, which confirms the equality after simplification. ### Using `sledgehammer`: In this particular lemma, `sledgehammer` might not be necessary because the proof is straightforward and can be handled by basic simplification. However, if you want to use `sledgehammer`, you can invoke it after stating the lemma to see if it suggests any automatic proof methods. In this case, `simp` is sufficient for both cases.

Assume `x ≠ y`. - If `x ≠ y`, there must exist some `n` such that `bit x n ≠ bit y n`, which contradicts our assumption. - We use `bit_eq_iff` to find such an `n` and derive a contradiction, thus proving `x = y`. 3. **Using `sledgehammer`**: - The `sledgehammer` tool can be used to find the `bit_eq_iff` lemma, which states that two integers are equal if and only if their bits are equal at every position.

This is a common technique when dealing with recursive functions like `foldr`. 2. **Base Case (`Nil`)**: When `as` is empty, `foldr` does nothing, so `dom (foldr (\\<lambda>p ps. ps (p \\<mapsto> f p)) [] g) = dom g`. This matches the right-hand side `dom g \\<union> set []`, which simplifies to `dom g`. 3. **Inductive Step (`Cons`)**: Assume the lemma holds for a list `as`, and prove it for `a # as`. - Define `?g'` as the result of folding `as` into `g`. - Show that folding `a # as` into `g` is equivalent to updating `?g'` with `a`. - Use the property of `dom` with function updates: `dom (?g' (a \\<mapsto> f a)) = dom ?g' \\<union> {a}`. - Apply the induction hypothesis to replace `dom ?g'` with `dom g \\<union> set as`. - Simplify the union operations to reach the conclusion. 4. **Use of `simp`**: The `simp` tactic is used to simplify expressions, especially when dealing with basic set operations and properties of `dom`. 5. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes by showing that the domain after folding `a # as` into `g` is `dom g \\<union> set (a # as)`, as required by the lemma.

This means that `v` is in the range of the function `f`. 2. **Using `ran_def`**: The definition of `ran` in Isabelle is typically given by `ran f = {y. \\<exists>x. f x = Some y}`. This definition states that a value `y` is in the range of `f` if there exists some `x` such that `f x = Some y`. 3. **Obtaining `x`**: Using the assumption and the definition of `ran`, we can obtain an `x` such that `f x = Some v`. This is done using the `obtain` construct, which allows us to extract the witness `x` from the existential quantifier in the definition of `ran`. 4. **Conclusion**: Finally, we conclude that there exists an `x` such that `f x = Some v`, which is exactly what we need to prove. The `thus` keyword is used to indicate that this is the conclusion of the proof. 5. **Automation with `auto`**: The `auto` method is used to handle straightforward logical steps and simplifications, such as applying the definition of `ran` and handling existential quantifiers.

Specifically, for a negative integer `k` less than `-2^n`, `signed_take_bit n k` can be expressed as `k + 2 ^ Suc n`. 3. **Proof Strategy**: - We first establish that if `k < - (2 ^ n)`, then `signed_take_bit n k = k + 2 ^ Suc n`.

This involves finding some `y` such that `f x = Some y` and `prj y` is also defined (i.e., `prj y \\<noteq> None`). 4. **Conclusion**: From `f x = Some y`, we conclude that `x` is in the domain of `f`, which is exactly what we need to show. 5. **Use of `sledgehammer`**: In this proof, `sledgehammer` can be used to automatically find the necessary lemmas or simplifications, especially for the step where we derive `f x = Some y` from the assumption `(prj \\<circ>\\<^sub>m f) x \\<noteq> None`.

The key insight is that `-1` in binary is an infinite sequence of 1s, which corresponds to `mask n` in the context of `take_bit`. 3. **Using `mask`**: The `mask n` function gives us `2^n - 1`, which is the binary number with the first `n` bits set to 1. We use the lemma `mask_eq_exp_minus_1` to express `mask n` as `2^n - 1`. 4. **Concluding with `-1`**: Finally, we show that `2^n - 1` is equivalent to `-1` in two's complement representation for the first `n` bits.

This is derived using the `in_set_conv_nth` lemma, which relates membership in a set derived from a list to the existence of an index. 3. **Contradiction with Distinctness:** - Given `distinct xs`, the elements at different indices must be different.

This splits the proof into two cases: when `xs` is `Nil` (empty) and when `xs` is `Cons a as` (non-empty). 2. **Case Nil:** - In the `Nil` case, `xs = []`. The goal simplifies to `case_list f g [] = If (True) f (g (hd []) (tl []))`. - Since `hd []` and `tl []` are undefined, the `If` expression simplifies to `f`, which matches `case_list f g [] = f`. - We use `by simp` to automatically simplify and solve this case. 3. **Case Cons:** - In the `Cons` case, `xs = a # as`. The goal simplifies to `case_list f g (a # as) = If (False) f (g (hd (a # as)) (tl (a # as)))`. - Here, `hd (a # as) = a` and `tl (a # as) = as`, so the `If` expression simplifies to `g a as`. - This matches `case_list f g (a # as) = g a as`. - Again, `by simp` is used to automatically simplify and solve this case. ### Using `sledgehammer`: In this particular proof, `sledgehammer` might not be necessary because the proof is straightforward and can be handled by basic simplification (`simp`). However, if you want to explore alternative proof strategies or confirm the proof's validity, you can invoke `sledgehammer` to see if it suggests any other tactics or methods."}

This structured proof uses basic logical reasoning and the properties of the conditional expression to establish the equivalence.

This is done using the lemma `mult_strict_mono`, which states that if `a < b` and `c > 0`, then `a * c < b * c`. 3. **Simplifying the Right Side:** - We simplify `2^k * 2^(m-k)` to `2^(k + (m-k))` using `power_add`. - Since `k + (m-k) = m`, this simplifies further to `2^m`. 4. **Conclusion:** - We use the `finally` keyword to chain the inequalities and conclude that `2^k * n < 2^m`.

This is captured in the `range_signed` fact. 3. **Comparing with \\(-2^n\\)**: - We need to show that \\(-2^n\\) is less than or equal to the lower bound of this range, \\(-2^{n-1}\\).

In both cases, the proofs rely on the basic property of pair equality, which states that two pairs are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal.

This is shown using the property `in_set_takeWhileD`, which states that elements in `takeWhile f xs` satisfy `f`. 3. **Contradiction**: We assume for contradiction that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `takeWhile f xs`. If this were true, then `xs ! n` would be part of `takeWhile f xs`, contradicting our assumption. 4. **Conclusion**: Since assuming `n` is less than or equal to the length of `takeWhile f xs` leads to a contradiction, we conclude that `length (takeWhile f xs) \\<le> n`. 5. **Proof Tools**: The proof uses `auto` and `fastforce` to handle logical deductions and set membership efficiently. `sledgehammer` can be used to suggest these steps if needed.

We will use `sledgehammer` to assist in finding relevant theorems and lemmas that can help us prove the lemma efficiently. Here's how you can translate the informal solution into a structured Isabelle proof: ```isabelle lemma bin_nth_minus1 [simp]: \"(bit :: int \\<Rightarrow> nat \\<Rightarrow> bool) (- 1) n\" proof - have \"(-1 :: int) = - (1 :: int)\" by simp also have \"... = NOT 0\" by simp also have \"... = -1\" by simp finally have \"(-1 :: int) = -1\" . then show ?thesis proof (induction n) case 0 then show ?case by simp next case (Suc n) then show ?case by simp qed qed ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Understanding the Representation**: The proof begins by recognizing that \\(-1\\) in two's complement is represented as an infinite sequence of 1s. This is because \\(-1\\) is equivalent to the bitwise NOT of 0, which results in all bits being set to 1. 2. **Induction on Natural Numbers**: We use induction on \\( n \\) to show that for any natural number \\( n \\), the \\( n \\)-th bit of \\(-1\\) is 1. 3. **Base Case**: For \\( n = 0 \\), the 0-th bit of \\(-1\\) is 1, which is straightforward since \\(-1\\) is represented as all 1s. 4. **Inductive Step**: Assuming the \\( n \\)-th bit is 1, we show that the \\( (n+1) \\)-th bit is also 1. This follows from the fact that \\(-1\\) is an infinite sequence of 1s. 5. **Sledgehammer**: While the proof is simple and doesn't necessarily require `sledgehammer`, it can be used to find supporting lemmas or theorems in the Isabelle library that confirm the properties of two's complement representation.

For `0`, its binary representation is simply `0`, regardless of how many bits you consider. 2. **Proof by Induction**: We use induction on `n` to show that `take_bit n 0 = 0` for any natural number `n`. - **Base Case**: When `n = 0`, `take_bit 0 0` is `0` because taking zero bits from `0` results in `0`. This is shown by `simp`, which simplifies the expression directly. - **Inductive Step**: Assume `take_bit n 0 = 0` holds for some `n`. We need to show `take_bit (Suc n) 0 = 0`. The binary representation of `0` remains `0`, so taking `Suc n` bits still results in `0`. Again, `simp` can handle this simplification. 3. **Conclusion**: By induction, we conclude that `take_bit n 0 = 0` for all natural numbers `n`.

Therefore, `size (xa # list) = Suc (size list)`. - From `Suc (size list) = Suc k`, we can deduce `size list = k` by the injectivity of the successor function `Suc`. 4. **Conclusion**: - We conclude `size list = k`, which is the desired result.

This step uses the `div_less` lemma, which states that if `a * b < c` and `b > 0`, then `a < c div b`. 3. **Simplification Using Exponent Properties**: We simplify `2 ^ m div 2 ^ n` to `2 ^ (m - n)` using the `power_diff` lemma, which is valid when `n ≤ m`. If `m < n`, both sides of the equation become `0`, which is handled by the `power_strict_decreasing_iff` lemma. 4. **Conclusion**: Finally, we conclude the proof by chaining the inequalities to show `q < 2 ^ (m - n)`. This structured proof follows the informal reasoning closely and uses Isabelle's powerful automation tools to handle the algebraic manipulations and case distinctions."}

This is achieved using the lemma `set_update_mem`. 3. **Function Application to Updated Set**: We show that applying `f` to this updated set results in the same set as applying `f` to the original set.

This transformation is crucial because it allows us to leverage the finiteness of `?S`. 3. **Subset Proofs**: We prove both directions of the set equality: - `?T ⊆ insert y {x. x \\<noteq> y \\<and> P x}`: For any `x` in `?T`, if `x = y`, it trivially belongs to the set. If `x ≠ y`, then `P x` must hold, so it belongs to `{x. x \\<noteq> y \\<and> P x}`. - `insert y {x. x \\<noteq> y \\<and> P x} ⊆ ?T`: For any `x` in the set, if `x = y`, it belongs to `?T`. If `x ≠ y` and `P x` holds, then `x` satisfies the condition for `?T`. 4. **Finiteness Conclusion**: Using the fact that adding a single element (`y`) to a finite set (`{x. x \\<noteq> y \\<and> P x}`) results in a finite set, we conclude that `?T` is finite.

We use the fact that `length (x # xs) = length ys` to deduce that `ys` must be of the form `y # ys'` where `length xs = length ys'`. 4. **Last Element of Zipped List:** We use the property of `last` on zipped lists, which can be derived using `last_zip`, to show that the last element of `zip (x # xs) ys` is `(last (x # xs), last ys)`. 5. **Butlast of Zipped List:** We apply the induction hypothesis to `xs` and `ys'` to show that `butlast (zip (x # xs) ys) = zip (butlast (x # xs)) (butlast ys)`. 6. **Combining Results:** Finally, we combine the results to conclude the proof for the inductive step.

This is a key insight because it directly relates to how bits are set in binary representation. 2. **Using `bit` Function**: The `bit` function checks if a particular bit is set. For `1 << n`, only the \\(n\\)-th bit is set, which is what we need to prove. 3. **Case Analysis**: We perform a case analysis on whether \\(m = n\\) or not: - **Case \\(m = n\\)**: The \\(n\\)-th bit of `1 << n` is `True` (or `1`), which matches our requirement. - **Case \\(m \\neq n\\)**: Any other bit position \\(m\\) is `False` (or `0`), which also matches our requirement. 4. **Using `sledgehammer`**: In practice, you would invoke `sledgehammer` after stating the lemma to see if it can automatically find a proof or suggest useful lemmas.

However, if you were to use `sledgehammer`, it could suggest relevant lemmas or simplifications that might help in more complex scenarios. ### Additional Considerations: - Ensure that the `take_bit` function is correctly understood in the context of your Isabelle environment. The function `take_bit` is typically used for bit manipulation, and its behavior should align with the informal understanding of bit truncation. - The proof relies on the basic arithmetic and logical properties of natural numbers, which are well-supported in Isabelle's standard library.

This is shown using `simp`. 2. **Inductive Step (`Cons`):** - Assume the property holds for lists `as` and `cs'` (inductive hypothesis). - We need to show it holds for `a # as` and `c # cs'`. - From the assumptions `lall1` and `lall2`, we know `P a c` and `Q a c` hold for the heads of the lists. - By the inductive hypothesis, `list_all2 (\\<lambda>a b.

We need to show the equivalence `f x \\<in> f ` S = (x \\<in> S)`. 2. **Forward Direction**: - Assume `f x \\<in> f ` S`. By the definition of image, there exists some `s` in `S` such that `f s = f x`. - Since `f` is injective, `f s = f x` implies `s = x`. This uses the property of injective functions, which can be invoked using `injD`. - Therefore, `x` must be in `S`. 3. **Backward Direction**: - Assume `x \\<in> S`. By the definition of image, `f x` is in `f ` S` because `f(S)` includes all images of elements of `S`, including `f(x)`. 4. **Conclusion**: Both directions are proven, so the equivalence holds. The proof uses basic logical reasoning and properties of injective functions. The `auto` method is used to handle straightforward logical steps, and `simp` with `injD` is used to apply the injective property. The `obtain` keyword is used to extract an element from the set image, which is a common technique in Isabelle proofs."}

This is necessary because the lemma is conditional on this assumption. 2. **Simplification**: We use the fact that `Suc (n - 1) = n` when `0 < n`. This is a straightforward simplification because `Suc` is the successor function, and when `n` is positive, `n - 1` is a valid natural number, making `Suc (n - 1)` equal to `n`. 3. **Conclusion**: With the simplification, the lemma becomes trivial because both sides of the equation are identical. We conclude the proof using `simp`, which handles straightforward equalities and simplifications. 4. **Use of `sledgehammer`**: In this particular case, `sledgehammer` might not be necessary because the proof is straightforward and relies on basic arithmetic simplifications.

The proof is divided into two parts: forward and backward directions. 2. **Forward Direction**: - We assume `{x} = set_option v` and need to show `v = Some x`. - We use `proof (cases v)` to perform case analysis on `v`. - **Case `None`**: If `v = None`, then `set_option v = {}`. This leads to a contradiction since `{x} ≠ {}`. - **Case `Some y`**: If `v = Some y`, then `set_option v = {y}`. Given `{x} = {y}`, it follows that `x = y`, and thus `v = Some x`. 3. **Backward Direction**: - We assume `v = Some x` and need to show `{x} = set_option v`. - This follows directly by the definition of `set_option`, which gives `set_option (Some x) = {x}`. 4. **Use of `sledgehammer`**: In this proof, `sledgehammer` can be used to automatically find proofs for simple steps like `set_option v = {}` when `v = None`, or `{x} = {y} ⟹ x = y`.

Thus, `Y p` is returned, which matches the right-hand side of the lemma when `e` is empty. 3. **Inductive Step (`Cons`):** For the inductive step, we consider two cases: - **Case `p = a`:** If `p` is the head of the list, then `Y(p)` is updated to `X(p)`. Thus, the result is `X(p)`, which matches the right-hand side of the lemma when `p` is in `set e`. - **Case `p ≠ a`:** If `p` is not the head, we apply the induction hypothesis to the tail `e` with the updated function `Y(a := X a)`.

Here's how you can structure the proof: ```isabelle lemma foldl_fun_upd: \"foldl (\\<lambda>s r. s(r := g r)) f rs = (\\<lambda>x. if x \\<in> set rs then g x else f x)\" proof (induction rs arbitrary: f) case Nil then show ?case by simp next case (Cons r rs) then have IH: \"foldl (\\<lambda>s r. s(r := g r)) f rs = (\\<lambda>x. if x \\<in> set rs then g x else f x)\" by simp show ?case proof fix x show \"(foldl (\\<lambda>s r. s(r := g r)) f (r # rs)) x = (if x \\<in> set (r # rs) then g x else f x)\" proof (cases \"x = r\") case True then show ?thesis by simp next case False then have \"x \\<noteq> r\" by simp hence \"(foldl (\\<lambda>s r. s(r := g r)) f (r # rs)) x = (foldl (\\<lambda>s r. s(r := g r)) f rs) x\" by simp also have \"... = (if x \\<in> set rs then g x else f x)\" using IH by simp finally show ?thesis using False by simp qed qed qed ``` ### Explanation of the Structured Proof: 1. **Induction on `rs`:** We use induction on the list `rs`. This is a common technique for proving properties about functions that process lists. 2. **Base Case (`Nil`):** When `rs` is an empty list, `foldl` does not perform any updates, so the result is simply the initial function `f`. This matches the right-hand side of the equation, which checks if `x` is in the empty set, resulting in `f x`. 3. **Inductive Step (`Cons`):** For the inductive step, we assume the property holds for a list `rs` and prove it for `r # rs`. - **Case `x = r`:** If `x` is the current element `r`, then the function is updated to return `g r`, which matches the right-hand side. - **Case `x ≠ r`:** If `x` is not `r`, the function is not updated at `x` in this step, so we rely on the inductive hypothesis for `rs`. We check if `x` is in the rest of the list `rs` and apply the inductive hypothesis. 4. **Conclusion:** The proof concludes by showing that the left-hand side of the equation matches the right-hand side for all cases, completing the induction. This structured proof follows the informal reasoning and uses Isabelle's proof tools to verify each step rigorously."}

The key observation is that subtraction in a ring is defined as addition with the negation of the second operand. This allows us to directly use the definition of subtraction to prove the equivalence. Here's how you can structure the proof in Isabelle: ```isabelle lemma plus_minus_one_rewrite: \"v + (- 1 :: ('a :: {ring, one, uminus})) \\<equiv> v - 1\" proof - have \"v - 1 = v + (-1)\" by (simp add: diff_conv_add_uminus) thus ?thesis by simp qed ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Proof Structure**: We start with a `proof -` block, indicating that we will provide a sequence of steps leading to the conclusion. 2. **Key Step**: - We use the fact that subtraction is defined as addition with the negation of the second operand. This is captured by the lemma `diff_conv_add_uminus`, which states that `v - 1` is equivalent to `v + (-1)`. - The `simp` method is used to apply this lemma, simplifying `v - 1` to `v + (-1)`. 3. **Conclusion**: - After establishing the equivalence, we conclude the proof with `thus ?thesis by simp`, which finalizes the proof by showing that the goal follows from the established equivalence. This proof effectively captures the reasoning from the informal solution, using Isabelle's existing lemmas and simplification capabilities to establish the desired equivalence."}

This is straightforward since \\(-1 = -1 + 2^n \\cdot 1\\). 2. **Modulo Properties**: We use the property that \\((a + b) \\mod m = (a \\mod m + b \\mod m) \\mod m\\) to split the modulo operation. 3. **Simplification**: We simplify using the fact that any multiple of \\(2^n\\) modulo \\(2^n\\) is zero, i.e., \\((2^n \\cdot 1) \\mod 2^n = 0\\). 4. **Equivalence**: We show that \\(-1 \\mod 2^n\\) is equivalent to \\((2^n - 1) \\mod 2^n\\) using the property of modulo equivalence and the fact that \\(-1\\) is equivalent to \\(2^n - 1\\) in the range of \\(0\\) to \\(2^n - 1\\). 5. **Conclusion**: Finally, we conclude the proof by showing that \\(-1 \\mod 2^n = 2^n - 1\\).

{"task_id":198,"natural_language_statement":"The lemma `lhs_sym_eq` states that the expression \"(a = b) = x\" is logically equivalent to \"(b = a) = x\". In natural language, this means that the truth value of the statement \"a equals b equals x\" is the same as the truth value of the statement \"b equals a equals x\". Essentially, it asserts the symmetry of equality with respect to a given truth value x.","formal_proof":"To translate the informal solution into a structured Isabelle proof, we will use the symmetric property of equality and logical equivalence. We can employ `sledgehammer` to automate some of the proof steps. Here's how you can structure the proof in Isabelle: ```isabelle lemma lhs_sym_eq: \"(a = b) = x \\<longleftrightarrow> (b = a) = x\" proof - have \"(a = b) \\<longleftrightarrow> (b = a)\" by (rule eq_commute) then show ?thesis by simp qed ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Understanding Equality**: - We start by recognizing that equality is symmetric, i.e., `a = b` is equivalent to `b = a`. This is captured by the `eq_commute` rule in Isabelle. 2. **Introducing the Truth Value x**: - The expressions `(a = b) = x` and `(b = a) = x` compare the truth values of `a = b` and `b = a` to `x`. Since `a = b` is equivalent to `b = a`, these expressions are logically equivalent. 3. **Logical Equivalence**: - We use the equivalence `(a = b) \\<longleftrightarrow> (b = a)` to simplify the original lemma. The `simp` method in Isabelle can automatically handle this simplification once the equivalence is established. 4. **Conclusion**: - The proof concludes by showing that the lemma holds due to the symmetric property of equality, which is directly applied using `eq_commute`. This structured proof captures the essence of the informal explanation and uses Isabelle's automation features to simplify the proof process."}
{"task_id":199,"natural_language_statement":"The lemma `drop_bit_bin_cat_eq` states that if you concatenate two binary numbers `v` and `w` using the `concat_bit` function with a specified number of bits `n`, and then drop the first `n` bits from the result, you will retrieve the original binary number `v`.","formal_proof":"To translate the informal solution into a structured Isabelle proof, we need to formalize the understanding of the operations involved and use Isabelle's proof tools to verify the lemma.

The definition of `concat_bit` is used to show that it is equivalent to shifting `v` left by `n` bits and adding the first `n` bits of `w`. 2. **Dropping Bits**: - We then focus on the operation `drop_bit n ((v << n) + (w mod 2^n))`. The goal is to show that this operation results in `v`. - The expression `(v << n) + (w mod 2^n)` is equivalent to `(v * 2^n) + (w mod 2^n)`, which is a more arithmetic representation. 3. **Simplifying the Expression**: - The key step is to use the property of `drop_bit` that `drop_bit n ((v * 2^n) + (w mod 2^n)) = v`. This is because `drop_bit n` effectively divides the number by `2^n`, which cancels out the `* 2^n` part and leaves `v`. 4. **Conclusion**: - The proof concludes by showing that the operations cancel out to leave `v`, thus proving the lemma. This structured proof uses the properties of bit manipulation and arithmetic to verify the lemma. The use of `simp` and `simp add:` helps in applying known simplifications and definitions to reach the conclusion."}
